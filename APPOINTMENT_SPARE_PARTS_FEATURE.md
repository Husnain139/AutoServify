## üíæ Data Structure

### How It Works:
1. When shopkeeper adds spare parts to an appointment:
   - Creates multiple `Order` objects (one per spare part)
   - Sets `bookingId` = appointment ID
   - Saves to Firestore "orders" collection

2. When viewing appointment details:
   - Queries all orders where `bookingId` = appointment ID
   - Calculates total from spare parts
   - Adds to service price for final total

### Example Data:
```kotlin
// Appointment
Appointment(
    id = "apt123",
    serviceName = "Car Oil Change",
    bill = "500",  // Service price
    ...
)

// Spare parts orders linked to this appointment
Order(
    bookingId = "apt123",  // Links to appointment
    item = PartsCraft(title = "Engine Oil", price = 800),
    quantity = 2,
    ...
)

Order(
    bookingId = "apt123",  // Same appointment
    item = PartsCraft(title = "Oil Filter", price = 200),
    quantity = 1,
    ...
)

// Total shown in AppointmentDetailActivity:
// Service: Rs. 500
// Parts: Rs. 1800 (800*2 + 200*1)
// Total: Rs. 2300
```
